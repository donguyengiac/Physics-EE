%All example calculations are taken from values for fret 7.
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Fret distance is $l_n$, calculated from the luthier equation (\ref{eqn6})
%    $$l_7 = \frac{.648}{\sqrt[12]{2^7}} = \SI{.432}{m}$$
%    \item Average frequency is simply average value of the 5 trials.\\
%    avg.$f = \frac{294.81 + 294.81 + 294.82 + 294.81 + 294.82 }{5} = \SI{294.81}{Hz}$
%    \item Note names correspond to standard note positions on G string on a standard guitar
%    \item Standard frequencies corresponding to notes. \cite{freq_chart} 
%    \item $\Delta f$ is the intonation deviation at each fret, calculated as the difference between the average frequency and the standard frequency.
%    $$\Delta f = 294.81 - 293.66 = \SI{1.15}{Hz}$$
%    \item Absolute uncertainty of $\Delta f$ is half the range of trial values up to 1 s.f \\
%    Abs. unc. of $\Delta f = (294.82-294.81)/2 = \SI{0.005}{Hz}$
