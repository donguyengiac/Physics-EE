\begin{enumerate}
    \item Setting up the guitar. I use the instructions by Stewmac \cite{stewmac}
    \item Connect the guitar to frequency measuring software. I use my audio interface to connect the guitar to my laptop, and the software I use is Visual Analyzer 2020 \cite{va20}. I choose this because it supports real-time Fast Fourier Transform to convert guitar signals into frequency spectrum, and can be configured to provide results with high accuracy. 
    \item Measure $f_0$ by plucking the string with no capo on.
    \item Pluck it 5 times with the pick, changing the plucking position each time as numbered in Figure \ref{fig4} (trial 1: above neck pickup, trial 2: between neck and middle, trial 3: above middle, trial 4: between middle and bridge, trial 5: above bridge pickup). Record the peak frequency (highest dB) for each pick (Figure \ref{fig6}). \label{enum4}
    \item Put capo on \nth{7} fret and repeat step \ref{enum4}. Ensure the edge of the capo sits right on top of the fret and pushing the string directly downwards. (Figure \ref{fig5})\label{enum5}
    \item Repeat step \ref{enum5} from fret 8 up to fret 16. I cannot go higher because this is where the neck meets the body making it impossible to put the capo.
