\begin{enumerate}
    \item Setting up the guitar. I used the instructions by Stewmac \cite{stewmac}
    \item Connect the guitar to frequency measuring software. I used my audio interface to connect the guitar to my laptop, and the software I used is Visual Analyzer 2020 \cite{va20}. I choose this because it supports Fast Fourier Transform in real-time to convert guitar signals into frequency spectrum, and can be configured to provide results with high accuracy. 
    \item Measure $f_0$ by plucking the string with no capo on.
    \item Pluck it 5 times with the pick, changing the plucking position each time as shown in Figure \ref{fig5} (trial 1: above the neck pickup, trial 2: between neck and middle, trial 3: above middle, trial 4: between middle and bridge, trial 5: above bridge pickup). Record the peak frequency (highest dB) for each pick. \label{enum4}
    \item Put capo on \nth{7} fret and repeat step \ref{enum4}. Ensure that the edge of the capo must be right on top of the fret and the capo is pushing the string straight downwards, not sideways. (Figure \ref{fig6})\label{enum5}
    \item Repeat step \ref{enum5} from fret 8 up to fret 16. I cannot go higher than this because this is where the neck meets the body, it is impossible to put the capo.
